module decoder1to32
(
output[31:0]  out,
input         enable,
input[4:0]    address
);
    assign out = enable<<address; 
endmodule

The '<<' operator is a bit shift, meaning out will be enable shifted over a number of places equal to address. This causes the output to be a string of zeroes with '1' in the number bit given by the address. This is consistent with the behavior we want from a decoder.
